Notes / observations

1) I didn't get any link / button into the design file to navigate the next steps. soÂ  I have just created the placeholder for Step 2 and step 3.

2) Designer used many shades of black and gray. It's hard to pick exact color code from JPEG. so I used two colors.

3) For the icons I am using the fontawesome CDN. if you provide the icons source then i will change with them.
